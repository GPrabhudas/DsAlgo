# DsAlgo
Problems solved in Data structures and Algorithms while practising on below topics
- Array
- Linkedlist
- Stacks
- Queues
- Binary Indexed tree(BIT)
- Trees
- Bit Magic.
- Sorting

Although I have not put all of them in Github you can find the problem statement by visiting my profile on
- Leetcode https://leetcode.com/prabhudas/
- Hackerrank https://www.hackerrank.com/prabhudas552

#### Arrays:
Array is one of the most used data structure and there are many interesting problems that can be solved using arrays and I'm putting 
here some them I tried when learning.
- Spiral Order of Matrix
- Implement K stacks in an array
- Find missing number in an array
- Search in sorted array and the list goes on.

#### Linkedlist
Like arrays linked list is also a linear data structure except that its elements are not stored in contigous location. 
Here are some the problems I tried and also submitted solution for most of the linked list problems on oline coding platforms 
like LeetCode and HackerRank.
- Detect a loop in linked list
- Detect a and remove loop in linked list
- Reverse a linked list
- Reverse a linked list in size of k
- Merge two sorted linked list and extend it to merge k sorted list.
- Print linked list in reverse order using recursion. etc

#### Stacks
Stack is a last in first out data structure(LIFO). There are many interesting problems to solve in stacks. Here are some of them.
- Maximum histogram in an array
- Next Greater element in the array
- Implement Queue using Stacks.
- Special Stack. Desgin stack that can support top,pop,push and min operations in o(1) time complexity.
- Implement k stacks in an array
- Reverse a stack using recursion
- Sort a stack using recursion etc.

####  Binary Heap
Binary heap is tree data structure with speacial properties like below
 - Max heap : Each node is greater than the its left and right child and same has to be followed by its subtrees.
 - Min Heap : Each node is smaller than the its left and right child and same has to be followed by its subtrees.
 
 Heap data structure has many advantages like
 - Find minimum in a running stream of integers
 - Find maximum in a running stream if integers
 - Find Median of incoming stream of integers
 - Merge K sorted linked lists
 - Merge K sorted arrays
 - Maximum distint in window of size k in an array etc.


 #### Sorting
 There are many sorting algorithms which can be used to sort array of elements. It is better to know about some basic sorting algorithms so that you can apply right 
 sorting algorithm which is appropriate to your scenario. Some of the sorting algorithms are:

 Comaprison based sorting algorithms.
 - Bubble sort. The first sorting algorithm to begin learning.
 - Insertion sort. 
 - Selection sort.
 - Merge sort.
 - Quick Sort.
 - Heap Sort.

 Non Comaprison based sorting algorithms:
 - Counting sort. It is actually used in Radix sort.
 - Radix Sort. 

#### Trees
 Trees is non linear data structure. Here are some the problems you can try out while learning Trees.
 - Constrct a tree from given Inorder and Postorder traversal.
 - Contruct a tree from given Inorder and Preorder traversal.
 - Bottom view of a binary tree
 - Left view of a binary tree
 - right view of a binary tree
 - Top view of a binary tree
 - Boundary traversal of a binary tree
 - Reverse level order traversal etc.
